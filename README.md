## Project Overview

### Data Preprocessing:
The dataset undergoes a series of preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling. These steps are essential for preparing the data for machine learning models.

### Machine Learning Model Comparison:
We implement and evaluate various machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model for predicting retail sales outcomes. This comparison includes models like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Network
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Model Evaluation:
Each model is evaluated using common metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) to assess performance and identify the most effective model for the data.

## Contents

- **Data**: Retail sales data for multiple sales representatives, including various features impacting sales.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning, encoding, and scaling the dataset.
- **Modeling**: Implementations of various machine learning models for comparison.
- **Evaluation**: Code to evaluate model performance using metrics and to visualize results(K-fold cross validation).

Jupyter notebook documenting the data analysis, preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.
